* MTL Related effects in train task
- Examined behavior unrelated and behavior related effects on left
  vs. right MTL
- Approximately 65% of left MTL electrodes were anterior
- All right MTL electrodes were anterior (verified by manual
  examination)
- Low Theta: 1-4 Hz, High Theta: 4-8 Hz, Alpha: 8-12 Hz
* Behavior unrelated effects
  [[file:figs/everything.png]]
- When examining peaks for behavior unrelated effects, there are 34
  left posterior peaks, 37 left anterior peaks, and 66 right anterior
  peaks. 
- Left MTL tends to lean towards alpha peaks, especially in posterior
- Right MTL tends to lean towards high theta peaks
** Example: Left Alpha Peak

   [[file:figs/everythingLeft.png]]
** Example: Right High Theta Peak 
  #+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
  [[file:figs/everythingRight.png]]
* Movement related effects
  [[file:figs/movement.png]]
- Analyzed movement power > stationary power
- 34 left posterior peaks, of which 15 are significant. 42 left
  anterior peaks, of which 30 are significant
- 77 right anterior peaks, of which 47 are significant
- Left posterior: exclusively significant at alpha. Left anterior:
  broadband significance
- Right anterior: Broadband, but concentrated at high theta
** Example: Left Alpha Peak
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75% 
   [[file:figs/moveLeft.png]]
** Example: Right High Theta Peak
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75% 
   [[file:figs/moveRight.png]]
* Memory related effects
  [[file:figs/memory.png]]
- Analyzed good memory power > bad memory power
- 32 left posterior peaks, of which 8 are significant. 39 left
  anterior peaks, of which 8 are significant
- 75 right anterior peaks, of which 51 are significant
- Left essentially not a factor in memory.
- Right: broadband, but concentrated at high theta
** Example: Right High Theta Peak
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75% 
   [[file:figs/memRight.png]]
* Speed related effects
  [[file:figs/speed.png]]
- Analyzed fast power > slow power
- 37 left posterior peaks, of which 17 are significant. 38 left
  anterior peaks, of which 15 are significant
- 75 right peaks, of which 40 are significant
- Left is primarily significant at alpha in both areas
- Right is again broadband, but concentrated around high theta
** Example: Left Alpha Peak
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75% 
   [[file:figs/speedLeft1.png]]
** Example: Left Alpha Peak 2
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75% 
   [[file:figs/speedLeft2.png]]
** Example: Right High Theta Peak
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75% 
   [[file:figs/speedRight.png]]
* Conclusions
- Overall, left has high activity in alpha, especially in posterior
  MTL
- Right usually sees broadband activation with concentration around
  high theta. Low theta and alpha activation is usually approximately
  equal
- Movement and speed seem to be driven by both hemispheres, but at
  their respective frequencies
- Memory is primarily driven by right MTL
- Handedness of subjects was not taken into account. This perhaps
  might alter results.
