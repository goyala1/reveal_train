* Theta Rhythm
  - In rodents, theta has been linked to spatial navigation/memory
    ("slow theta") and movement speed ("fast" theta) 
  - In humans, debate exists concerning the relevance and localization
    of the theta rhythm. Slower than rodents? Where in the
    hippocampus? 
  - Recent work (Bohbot et al., 2017) has implicated high theta in
    human navigation
  - Rodent work (Royer et al., 2010) found a decrease in theta moving from dorsal to
    ventral hippocampus (analogous to moving from posterior to
    anterior in humans), but the theta frequency was not defined
  - Other work in humans (Duarte et al., 2016) found low theta in both anterior
    and posterior, with high theta only in anterior in a spatial
    navigation task requiring memory (but only 1 subject)
* MTL Related effects in train task
- Train task allows us to disentangle movement from memory to parse
  out the theta rhythms more precisely
- Examined behavior unrelated and behavior related effects on left
  vs. right MTL and anterior vs. posterior for left MTL
- Approximately 65% of left MTL electrodes were anterior
- All right MTL electrodes were anterior 
- Low Theta: 1-4 Hz, High Theta: 4-8 Hz, Alpha: 8-12 Hz
* Behavior unrelated effects
- When examining peaks for behavior unrelated effects, there are 34
  left posterior peaks, 37 left anterior peaks, and 66 right peaks. 
- Left MTL tends to lean towards alpha peaks, especially in posterior
- Right MTL tends to lean towards high theta peaks

* Conclusions
- Overall, left has high activity in alpha, especially in posterior
  MTL
- Right usually sees broadband activation with concentration around
  high theta. Low theta and alpha activation approximately
  equal
- Movement and speed seem to be driven by both hemispheres, but at
  their respective frequencies
- Memory is primarily driven by right MTL
* Thoughts
- Peak picking too strict? 
- Hemispheric dominance of subjects? 
- Is the speed related analysis a good one to keep? 
- Encoding vs. retrieval of memory? 
- What to do next?
